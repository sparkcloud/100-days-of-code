# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: June 30, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Announce commitment to the challenge and read up on tutorials regarding data structures from freecodecamp.org site.

**Thoughts:** I'm struggling to feel capable in my abilities to code and any self validation on being productive. Looking at possible solutions, I've decided to pursue the 100 days of code challenge and use this repo as a method for work accountabillity and tracking.

### Day 1: July 1, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Revisit existing game project and tasks I was responsible for

**Thoughts:** I dislike the feeling of returning to a project that has been on the back burner for so long that time needs to be spent acclimating myself to the needs of the project or the focus required to be able to do the complex thinking and problem solving required to arrive at a solution. My poor habit of leaving things to the last minute are apparent to me as I write this  log entry at 4 in the morning to keep up with my commitment to myself. I will make it a goal to do the hour early in the day to be able to think competently and have a more productive feeling.

Aside from this however, the work done for todays entry revisited old problems I simply patched in to make the proposed dealine on the projects sprints. Having to get use to "good enough" solutions to revisit them are kind of annoying but I guess is part of the learning process. I needed to remind myself of the usage of delegate methods using Ienumerators in c# and learned how you don't always need to return something back in an Ienumerator block by simply using "yield break" to serve as a "return".

Reviewed older project documents created and reassessed a graphical model of the project I created for my own understanding.
The hr involved doing some cleanup work on some errors I was encountering in running of the project and placing some defensive coding in certain places.

the real problems and work I needed to do didn't appear obvious to me until the last few mins of the hour. Some funky stuff was happening between a script I wrote and another written by my senior colleague which I will need to tinker with to better understand how their code and my code behave independently and together.

in the meantime, I wil be going to bed. I hope I can curb this habit and stick to a more healthy pattern of completing the challenge.

### Day 1: July 2, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Reviewing scripts for the unity game project and understanding the game configuration details

**Thoughts:** While there has been some improvement with the approach to resolving some previous issues in the unity project, at times, the complexities of the underlying framework can be a hinderence to getting some things up and running. While this is more of a personal gripe from a lack of familiarity with the code base, it can be often time discouraging in feeling like progress has been made when time is set aside uderstanding how all the small moving parts in this complex machine should be working.

After stepping through some foreign code I hadn't written myself, I was able to see how I could improve upon older scripts I had written and implement the more detailed functionality that was outlined in our projects task list. There is still some ways to go before I can test it but at least it's closer to being realized. I learned a bit regarding how to properly check for float's close to 0 using Math.epsilon in unity as well as experimenting with unity's cloud build feature. A luxury feature the team I'm in wasn't taking advantage of which I figured I could tinker with while we still have the option available to us.

before starting todays hour of coding, I needed and told myself to finish an article I stumbled upon regarding finding purpose in ones life. The article hadn't really offered much to me that I didn't already know, but the one gem that I did pick up after reading it was that the act of persistence is itself it's own merit and gives one life meaning. The article's quote from Lao Tzu’s “Tao" mentions “One who persists is a person of purpose.” With the act of participating in this 100daysofcode challenge, it certainly helps in keeping up my pace to get better and enthused to code.
